				<p>Techspot is an excellent source for tech-related news, and reviews on devices. You can even buy
				merchandise and buy online courses</p>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">Github.com</a>
				<p>Every developer should know about Github. This is the place to store software.</p>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
				<p>Hacker News is a less flashy news site for nerds. It's not always computer-related; posts 
				can vary from new software, to new discoveries in the world of physics or space.</p>
